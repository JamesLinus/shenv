{"name":"Shenv","tagline":"A set of scripts to create custom shell environments for different projects/activities","body":"Shell Environments v1.2\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n#### Why do you need this?\r\n  \r\nLet's say you are working on something and you've cd'ed to directories deep in your filesystem, you have set up your own aliases, your own functions and other shell variables which help you in executing what you are working on better. Don't you get irritated if you want to open a terminal and want to cd every time, create these functions/variables/aliases, etc? SHENV helps you in creating mini environments for each of such project directories!\r\n\r\n### Shell Support\r\n \r\n1. [Bash](https://github.com/sathyamvellal/shenv/tree/master/bash/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Advantages/Features\r\n\r\n1. You can create closed environments for different projects/activities that you do.\r\n2. While in an environment, if you just `cd` in your terminal, you won't end up in the home directory but rather in the environment's root directory which you specify. \r\n3. Create variables, alises and functions for an environment and don't even worry about unsetting/unaliasing them!\r\n\r\n### Instructions and Usage\r\n \r\nFor bash users\r\n\r\n1. Copy the envrc file `bash/.bashenvrc` to a location you desire and source it in your `.bashrc`a\r\n2. Create a directory with the name `.shenv` in your home directory. This folder is used for storing all environment scripts that SHENV creates for you. If you want to change it, just set the variable `SHENV_HOME` at line 3 in the envrc file, to the directory you want to use as the `SHENV_HOME`.\r\n3. To create a new environment, use `envcreate <name> <directory>` where **name** is the name of the environment and **directory** is the *absolute* path to the environment's root.\r\n4. To start an environment, use `envstart <name>` where **name** is the name of the environment\r\n5. Similarly, to end the environment, use `envend <name>`. \r\n6. You can add all your custom aliases, functions, environment variables in the `envinit` function in `<name>/shenv.sh` that is created at your `SHENV_HOME` directory.\r\n\r\n#### An example (for bash)\r\n\r\nThere are three associative arrays that SHENV uses. `variables`, `aliases` and `functions`.  \r\nYou populate these in the `envinit` function (as specified above). Like so -\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nvariables[FILE]='$ENV_ROOT/file.txt'\r\naliases[run]='rake generate && rake preview'\r\nfunctions[mkcd]='mkdir -p $1 && cd $1' # NOTE the single quotes !!\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you start the environment with `envstart`, you can use these like any other shell variable, alias or a function. Like so -\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat $FILE\r\nrun # rake generate && rake preview\r\nmkcd foo # create directory 'foo' and cd to it\r\n```\r\nNote that SHENV is not yet able to update your `PATH` or `CLASSPATH` in an environment and later restore them. \r\n \r\n### Coming Next\r\n \r\n1. Update variables in an environment and restore them later. (like `PATH`, `CLASSPATH`, etc)\r\n2. Support for Z-Shell.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014, Sathyam M Vellal\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
